##Abstract

We are experimenting in a piece of Glass and yes, it is awesome! Google has pushed strong it's Mirror API as the main way to communicate with Glass and only recently they released the [GDK](https://developers.google.com/glass/gdk) (Android) for Glass, still `need cooler adjectives` the question is, what can be done with it?

In this talk we will go over the process and new challenges of developing a fully functional Glass app on Mirror API top of Node.js, and what new challenges and new tools we've built along the way.

We will discuss a bit of how the main apps are interacting with the users, share our learnings on how a Glass app differ from a traditional web app and to manage user life-cycle in Glass, from how to auth to how to message them and listen for updates, while keeping in mind the UX guidelines.

There will be up to 3 demos, building interactive stories with glass (mirror), image eating monster (mirror), and real-time information consumption (GDK).
