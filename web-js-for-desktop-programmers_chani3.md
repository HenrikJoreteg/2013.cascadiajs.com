##Abstract

Switching from desktop to web development is... a big change. While I'm still in the middle of this transition, I'd like to talk about some of the pitfalls I've encountered.

This talk will cover:
* ways to f*** up callbacks
* biases (it's "just" web development, right?)
* browser hells
* responsive design
and more, if there's time.

It will not cover:
* javascript syntax
* basic html/css

This could also work as an unconference topic - I'd love to hear about other people's experiences.
