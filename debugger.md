I work for Mozilla and help developers write web apps. In my heart I'm
an idealist but I've learned to mix practicality with idealism when
approaching software problems. I have a heavy functional programming
background with Scheme, and used to write DirectX games in high-school
in C++. In fact, I wrote a text-based RPG on my TI-82 calculator
during math class in 7th grade. It didn't take off like I thought it
would.
