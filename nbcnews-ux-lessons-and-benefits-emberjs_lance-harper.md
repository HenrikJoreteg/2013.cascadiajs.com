##Abstract

As a member of the UX R&D team for NBCNews Digital Group (nbcnews.com, today.com, msnbc.com among others), we are always looking for ways to improve the experiences for users visiting our websites across devices. Recently, we have focused our attention on SPAs using EmberJS to attempt to mimic the benefits of native devices while offering the ubiquity, functionality, and shareability of the web. 
I'd like to discuss our experiences with this framework, including benefits and frustrations.

These include: 

* Responsive JS capabilities for rendering experience catered to device resolution that go beyond CSS media queries and how we implemented this in part using EmberJS.
* Leveraging EmberJS to drive the requirements for the API needed to power the app
* Development workflow leveraging Grunt and NodeJS to allow for rapid feedback for developers and designers
* Continuous Consumption strategies for loading new elements
* Benefits of a development workflow from being back-end platform agnostic
* Rendering strategies for heterogenous data
* SEO considerations
* Pre-fetching data for optimizing performance
* Benefits and liabilities compared with BackboneJS
* Custom testing page to serve as a living specification for back-end developers to match using EmberJS
* Learning curve
